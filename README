  

 Before St. John Baptist De La Salle left this world, he loved all the things that God gave for him in the end.
This made me realize that created all things with a purpose. This reminds me on the saying "that the greatest way
to connect people and their purposes is by UNDERSTANDING EACH OTHERS". God has the power to communicate to us, for us to 
enable to understand our fellow people. It might be a sign to alert you what God is trying to tell you. Every person has a heart for all things on earth all that is given was for man and the animals.

 This is a very inspirational content because not all of us are contented on what we have now. Things that appear to us in this world are preparations for what god has in store for us in heaven. Adore, praise , glorify and worship God for all this are gifts from Him for us to enjoy. God also gave us the freedom to do everything we want but I know some are abusing the freedom that God has given to us. We will not last long on Earth. We will all be judge at Judgment Day by our creator.
